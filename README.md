# OpenGL 1.1: Anaglyph Stereo
 
  Some objects in 3D.  The arrow keys can be used to rotate the object.  The number keys 1 through 6 select the object.  
  The space bar toggles the use of anaglyph stereo.


The program is in Java therefore, you will need to set up Eclipse to use the JOGL API. See Subsection 3.6.2 (http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c3/s6.html#gl1geom.6.2) for instructions on doing that. The basic idea is to make a "User Library" containing the JOGL files. Then you can start a new project and add the JOGL user library to the project. There are copies of the JOGL .jar files and the native libraries for Linux in  /classes/cs424/JOGL-support. (Note: There is no need to make copies of these files, if you are using them on Linux. Your User Library can can refer directly to the copies in /classes/cs424/JOGL-support.) You can also get copies of the .jar files and the native libraries for Linux, Windows, or Mac from  http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs424/jogl_2_3_support/. Be sure to read all the instructions in the textbook and follow them carefully!
